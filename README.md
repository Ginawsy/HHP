# HHP

This project aims to reduce the number of unnecessary hospitalizations and related costs by predicting how many days a patient will spend in a hospital in the next year.

# Question
- Classification of Hospitalization.
- Pair of Features contributing to Staying.
-  Prediction of Length of Stay in the Hospital.

# Data

- Missing Values
- Top Coding
- Truncation of Claims 
- Suppression
- High risk patient(Not included)

## Model 
- Random Forest 
- Lasso Regression
- Ensemble Model
- Iterative Random Forest

## Result
- Majority requires fewer than 2 days of hospitalization.
- Hospitalization: types of services and group conditions.
- Length of stay: age and the severity of the illness.
- Payment of delay: number of claims, drugs, lab tests, and people who are in the evaluation group.

## Limitation
- Missing Values and High-Risk Patients
- Ways of Blending Models
- Other Models Selections
